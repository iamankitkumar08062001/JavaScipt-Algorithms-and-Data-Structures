# Data Structures #s

The following are the Data Structures I implemented:-

|S.No|Data Structure|File Name|
|:--:|:------------:|:-------:|
| 1  |     Set      |  set.js |
| 2  | Singly Linked List | singlyLinkedList.js |

## 1. Set ##
A set is an abstract data type that can store unique values, without any particular order. It is a computer implementation of the mathematical concept of a finite set.

## 2. Singly Linked List ##
A linked list is a linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory, Instead, each element points to the next.
